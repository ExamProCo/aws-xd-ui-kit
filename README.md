## Why Use Adobe XD For Building Architects
Adobe XD recently renamed their Symbols functionality to Components adding a new host features such as better responsive dragging and importing en-mass replacement information. 

One of our favourite features of Adobe XD is the ability to share documents with other team-members similar to how you can share🤝 a google doc. So hence, The UX Engineer👩🏼‍🎨 + Stakeholder🕵‍♂ + Cloud Architects🧙‍♂ + Developers👨🏽‍💻 can all have a look and advocate for the User & Business. 

## Why did we build🛠 this on Adobe XD ?
If you have yet to give Adobe XD a try, you should because it is free to use.
 
With both Adobe XD features to sync new file changes and Components feature, it allows us to ship user-centric architect diagrams to clients quickly.
